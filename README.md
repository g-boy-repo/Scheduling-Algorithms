# Scheduling-Algorithms

In my Operating System Course we have to write a program that will stimulate First Come First Serve(FCFC), Shortest Job First(SJF), shortest remaining time next(SRTnext), and Round Robin(with quantum = 4 milliseconds) scheduling algorithms.

Program Task: For each algorithm, the program should compute waiting time and turn around time of every job as well as the average waiting time and average turn around time.

I used the following data below to test my program. Considering the context switching time is 0.

Process: P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6

Arrival: 0 3 5 9 10 11

Time CPU Burst (in milliseconds): 6 2 1 7 4 3


In part B, used the program above and change the context switching time to 0.4 milliseconds. Compared outputs from both runs and showed(print) a message below which algorithm would be the better policy for the given process mix.
